config-gui
==========

Presents the user with a gui to configure applications.

One of the frustrating parts of using open source projects is the need to manually edit config files. 
I understand the power and logic behind this system but for newcomers it can be daunting. 

My idea is to create a front-end application to make configuring these files easier.
